"Flip the Latch and Rise: A Structured Learning Path to Succes For All Levels"

Missing - Weaving in the dev cycle, and leveraging llms productively

FASCICLE 1: FOUNDATIONS
Complete Learning Arc: Zero → Working sequential puzzles with architectural understanding
Chapter 1: Basic DSL Operations - "Opening Your Eyes"

Zork Implementation: White House opening scene - "open mailbox" reveals leaflet
Subsystem Focus: Basic effect creation and linking
Student Success: "look" and "open mailbox" commands work

Chapter 2: Object Interaction - "Getting Things"

Zork Implementation: Forest path, "climb tree", "get egg" from nest
Subsystem Focus: Spatial system introduction - flexible movement beyond directions
Student Success: Contextual navigation and spatial object acquisition

Chapter 3: Access Control - "The Key Under the Door"

Zork Implementation: Find skeleton key, "unlock grating with key", "open grating"
Subsystem Focus: Sequential constraints and parser complexity
Student Success: Multi-step puzzle with constraint validation

Chapter 4: Foundation Integration - RETROSPECTIVE

Student Task: Build 3-4 room adventure combining basic effects + spatial system + sequential puzzle
Validation: Can foundation subsystems compose together cleanly?


FASCICLE 2: SYSTEM COORDINATION
Complete Learning Arc: System coordination → Complex environmental behaviors
Chapter 5: Environmental Effects - "The Dam"

Zork Implementation: Dam controls affecting water levels and downstream navigation
Subsystem Focus: Cross-system effect coordination
Student Success: Actions in one location affect other locations

Chapter 6: Collection Systems - "The Trophy Case"

Zork Implementation: Gather multiple treasures, victory conditions through collection
Subsystem Focus: Achievement tracking and collection validation
Student Success: Progress tracking triggers victory logic

Chapter 7: Resource Management - "The Torch"

Zork Implementation: Light depletion, torch/lamp management over time
Subsystem Focus: Resource consumption and metering system integration
Student Success: Time-based resource constraints create strategic decisions

Chapter 8: System Coordination Integration - RETROSPECTIVE

Student Task: Build adventure where environmental changes enable treasure collection requiring resource management
Validation: Can environmental + collection + resource systems coordinate meaningfully?


FASCICLE 3: ADVANCED ARCHITECTURE
Complete Learning Arc: Temporal systems → Complete mini-Zork + DSL design mastery
Chapter 9: Temporal Sequencing - "The Timed Gate"

Zork Implementation: Time-sensitive puzzle sequences with countdown pressure
Subsystem Focus: Temporal effects and scheduling system integration
Student Success: Time-critical mechanics with failure/recovery states

Chapter 10: Agent Management - "The Cyclops"

Zork Implementation: Cyclops responds to "Odysseus" or food+water, affects room access
Subsystem Focus: Agent management system with dynamic entity behavior
Student Success: Non-player entities with persistent state changes

Chapter 11: State Accumulation - "The Echo Chamber"

Zork Implementation: "Echo" command builds sound, specific reset word clears acoustics
Subsystem Focus: Multi-system integration (Metering + Environmental + Temporal)
Student Success: Accumulation mechanics toward threshold with reset capability

Chapter 12: Ritual Sequences - "Bell, Book, and Candle"

Zork Implementation: Complete Temple/Hades exorcism ritual sequence
Subsystem Focus: Complete architecture mastery - all 11 subsystems integrated
Student Success: RING BELL → GET CANDLES → LIGHT MATCH → LIGHT CANDLES → READ BOOK
