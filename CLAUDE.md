When coming up with solutions, come up with only what is asked for. Do not embellish.

When coming up with solutions, use the existing architecture, do not make up your own.
If the existing architecture is conflicting with a stated goal,
let me know before going further.

Inform me of whatever project instructions you would find useful, when it occurs to you.

The management hierarchy - each level owns its effects
The composition strategy - effects first, then actions
The execution model - everything builds to one computation for topLevel
The effect ownership - no cross-scope effect processing

You will not declare when a problem is fixed.
You will not attempt to test code or compile it.
You will only report when you have completed your task.
