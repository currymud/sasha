example sentence
press the red button
assuming the press action for the red button is found ...
do action means making a continuation that adds a value from a sum type to a
Set and adding that continuation to the existing one in the "Go North" action field
replacing the "you can't go north" message in the current "Go North" 
In our case, the door is opened with the buttons. So that continuation is run
at the top of the execution loop
if the result of running the continuation is the fully populated set, the conditions for
"going north" have been met.

In the event the wrong button is pushed, the existing continuation for "go north" is replaced
with "You can't go north", and the player has to start over.
