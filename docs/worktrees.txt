> how can I have git-worktree have you work in multiple project 
  directories

● To use git worktrees with Claude Code across multiple project
  directories, you can:

  1. Create worktrees for different branches:
  git worktree add ../sasha-feature feature-branch
  git worktree add ../sasha-hotfix hotfix-branch

  2. Navigate between worktrees in Claude Code:
  - Use cd /path/to/worktree to switch directories
  - Each worktree maintains its own working state
  - Claude Code will recognize the git context in each worktree

  3. List existing worktrees:
  git worktree list

  4. Remove worktrees when done:
  git worktree remove ../sasha-feature

  This lets you work on multiple branches simultaneously without
  switching branches in your main repository. Each worktree is a
  separate working directory with its own checkout of a specific branch.
