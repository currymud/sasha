> analyse SashaDemo in terms of the Effect Algebra, and explain the algebra in terms of SashaDemo to 
  someone who is unfamiliar with Category Theory with compassion

● I'll analyze SashaDemo through the lens of the Effect Algebra and explain it in an accessible way. Let
  me first explore the codebase to understand both the Effect Algebra and SashaDemo implementation.

  Understanding the Effect Algebra Through SashaDemo: A Gentle Introduction

  Imagine you're directing a small interactive story where a character wakes up in a bedroom. The Effect 
  Algebra is like a choreography system that helps you coordinate what happens when - without getting
  tangled up in complexity.

  The Story: Opening Your Eyes

  In SashaDemo, you start with your eyes closed in a bedroom. When you type "open eyes", several things
  happen:
  - You can suddenly see the bedroom, floor, chair, and robe
  - You gain the ability to pick up the robe
  - You discover the robe has a pocket you can open

  How the Effect Algebra Works (Without the Math!)

  Think of the Effect Algebra as building blocks that snap together:

  1. Effects are Changes: Each effect is a specific change - like "now you can see the chair" or "now you
  can pick up the robe"
  2. Two Ways to Connect Effects:
    - "alongside" = Things happening at the same time (like turning on multiple lights at once)
    - "andThen" = Things happening in sequence (like unlocking a door, then opening it)

  In code, when you open your eyes:
  Enable seeing the bedroom ALONGSIDE
  Enable seeing the floor ALONGSIDE
  Enable seeing the chair ALONGSIDE
  Enable seeing the robe ANDTHEN
  Enable opening the pocket ANDTHEN
  Enable getting the robe

  The Hierarchy: Who Owns What

  The system has a simple rule: each entity manages its own abilities. Think of it like:
  - The Player knows how to look, get things, and open things
  - The Bedroom knows how to describe itself when looked at
  - The Robe knows how to be picked up and examined
  - The Pocket knows how to be opened

  Nobody reaches into someone else's space - the robe can't suddenly make the player jump, and the player
  can't rewrite the bedroom's description.

  Why This Matters

  Without this system, game logic becomes spaghetti - effects triggering effects triggering effects with
  no clear ownership. The Effect Algebra provides:

  1. Clear Ownership: You always know which entity is responsible for what
  2. Predictable Timing: Effects either happen together or in sequence - no surprises
  3. Safe Composition: You can combine simple effects into complex behaviors without breaking things

  The Beautiful Part

  Here's what makes this elegant: you write what you mean. Instead of:
  effect1(); effect2(); effect3(); // programmer has to remember order matters

  You write:
  effect1 alongside effect2 andThen effect3  // the meaning is in the code

  The system guarantees your effects will compose correctly - like LEGO blocks that only fit together in
  ways that make sense.

  In Human Terms

  Imagine teaching someone to make breakfast:
  - "Crack eggs ALONGSIDE heat pan ANDTHEN pour eggs into pan"

  The Effect Algebra lets you express game logic this naturally while ensuring everything happens
  correctly behind the scenes. You focus on what should happen; the algebra handles how to make it happen
  reliably.

  This is the gift of the Effect Algebra: it takes complex coordination problems and makes them as simple
  as describing what you want to happen, when you want it to happen, without worrying about the intricate
  machinery underneath.
