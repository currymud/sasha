> I've been in the process of refactoring. Study git history to understand my goals. 
  So I have a codebase sufficiently communicative in terms of consistent patterning 
  such that we may proceed with the narrative effect system?

● I'll study the git history to understand your refactoring goals and assess if the
  codebase is ready for the narrative effect system.

● Yes, your codebase demonstrates excellent consistency for proceeding with the
  narrative effect system. From the refactoring pattern:

  1. Effect Algebra (Sasha/EffectAlgebra.hs): You've established composable effects
  with Sequential and Parallel operators (andThen, alongside)
  2. Type-safe Behaviors (Sasha/HasBehavior.hs, HasEffect.hs): Clear type families
  mapping verbs to action functions, unified HasEffect interface for all entities
  3. Hierarchy Preserved: Each entity (Player/Location/Object) owns its
  ActionManagementFunctions, no cross-scope processing
  4. Clean Composition (SashaDemo.hs:180-189): Effects compose declaratively before
  action binding:
  buildEffects $
    buildEffect (...) `alongside`
    buildEffect (...) `andThen`
    buildEffect (...)
  5. Narration Structure (Model/Core.hs:550-553): Already has _playerAction and
  _actionConsequence fields ready for narrative effects

  The architecture maintains the four core principles consistently throughout. The
  effect system can now extend to narrative effects using the same compositional
  patterns.
