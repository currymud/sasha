● Current Migration Status - ContainerAccessActionF to Role-Based System

  ✅ Completed Work:

  1. Role-based types and keys defined in Model/Core.hs
  2. ProcessEffect handlers added for all role-based container access operations in GameState/ActionManagement.hs
  3. Lookup functions created for role-based types (SimpleVerb and VerbPhrase variants)
  4. EDSL fully updated:
    - SashaLambdaDSL: Added declarations, management, and effects
    - GameBuilder: Added interpretDSL patterns and GID counters
    - HasBehavior: Added role-based behavior creation functions

  🔄 Current State:

  - Both systems coexist - old ContainerAccessActionF and new role-based types work in parallel
  - Build integrity maintained - no breaking changes yet
  - Backward compatibility preserved - existing code still functions

  📝 Next Steps (Step 5 - Usage Sites):

  Starting point for next session should be updating the usage sites in order:
  1. Player/Open.hs - Convert to AgentContainerAccessActionF
  2. Objects/Open.hs - Update openContainerF
  3. ActionDiscovery/Open.hs - Use role-specific lookups
  4. SashaDemo.hs - Update function signatures
  5. GameState.hs - Update player action management

  🎯 Key Migration Pattern:

  - Player → Agent role
  - Location → Location role
  - Object → Object role
  - Instrument → Instrument role

  The migration is approximately 40% complete with the foundational work done. The remaining 60% involves updating usage sites and
   final cleanup.
